# Intro-to-Programming

Name:   Stephen Lovell
School: Southwest Technical College
Course: Introduction to Programming

This is a general repository for use in the Intro to Programming course I'm going to be taking (or am taking currently, or even took in the past, depending on when you read this). For the moment, that's rather open-ended, but I'll edit this with a better explanation as time goes on.

My name's Stephen (as you probably gathered above), and I've always been interested in learning new things, from random word origins to obscure mathematical conundrums. Whether that love of learning stems from an interest in what I can accomplish with the addition of a new skillset or just a simple love of novelty, I can't say for sure, but it's probably some combination of the two. Either way, computer-related skills have always been of particular interest to me, due to the sheer, near-infinite scope of possibility they present, and what better core skill is there in the realm of computer science than programming itself? I have some working understanding of coding going into this course, but I look forward to refining that understanding and polishing my skills.
